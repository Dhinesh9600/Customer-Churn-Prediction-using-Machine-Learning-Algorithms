# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn patterns to identify key factors influencing customer retention and predict potential churn. The analysis leverages data visualization and machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights for improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains customer demographic information, service usage details, and churn status. The key features include customer tenure, monthly charges, payment methods, and support interactions.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Objectives
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Churn Prediction Model
- Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics

## 📌 Steps Involved
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and outliers.
2. **EDA:** Visualizing trends and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features for better predictions.
4. **Model Building:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
5. **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

## 🚀 Results and Insights
- Identified key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Built a predictive model with an accuracy of XX%.
- Suggested targeted strategies to improve customer retention.
